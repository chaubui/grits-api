=======

To run the tests:

    cd test
    python -m unittest discover

Many tests are based on the comments in this document:

Classifier Data
===============
Three files are required to operate the classifier: training.p, validation.p, ontologies.p
These will be downloaded from our S3 bucket by default, however that bucket might not
be available to you, or it might no longer exist. In that case, ontologies.p can be
generated by running the mine_ontologies.py but the training and validation pickles
are generated from HealthMap metadata which we do not have permission to distribute.
The corpora directory includes code for iterating over HM data stored
in a girder database, scraping and cleaning the content of the linked source articles,
and generating pickles from it.
