# grits-api

This project provides the backend for the GRITS [diagnostic-dashboard](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/diagnostic-dashboard). The main API which it furnishes, accessible at `/diagnose`, takes an incoming document and returns a differential disease diagnosis and numerous extracted features for that document.

This project also provides resources for training the classifier model used to make disease predictions, and for managing long-running classification tasks over large corpora.

# Dependencies

Aside from the requirments noted in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) which may be installed as usual with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, this project also relies on the annotation library [annie](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/annie).

# Installation and set-up

## As part of total GRITS deployment

You may elect to install all GRITS components at once (this backend, the front-end [diagnostic-dashboard](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/diagnostic-dashboard), and the [girder](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/girder) database) by following the instructions in the [grits-deploy-scripts](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/grits-deploy-scripts) project.

The provided deploy script [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) will fetch all dependencies, include nltk data and annie, and use `supervisorctl` to launch the API server and celery processes for managing diagnoses. (TODO Nathan please flesh this out a little bit)

This deploy script relies on config files and other steps performed by [grtis-deploy-scripts](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/grits-deploy-scripts), so should not be used in isolation.

## Standalone

To run this project in isolation, without deploying the entire GRITS suite, clone this repository:

    $ git@github.com:ecohealthalliance/grits-api.git

Copy the default config to the operative version and edit it to suit your environment:

    $ cp config.sample.py config.py

Install the pip requirements:

    $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

Get the [annie]([diagnostic-dashboard](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/annie) project and make sure it's in your pythonpath.

Start the server:

	$ python server.py

# Testing

To run the tests:

    git clone -b fetch_4-18-2014 git@github.com:ecohealthalliance/corpora.git
    cd test
    python -m unittest discover

Many tests are based on the comments in this document:

# Classifier Data

## Using existing classifier data

Three files are required to operate the classifier: training.p, validation.p, ontologies.p
These will be downloaded from our S3 bucket by default, however that bucket might not
be available to you, or it might no longer exist. In that case, ontologies.p can be
generated by running the mine_ontologies.py but the training and validation pickles
are generated from HealthMap metadata which we do not have permission to distribute.
The corpora directory includes code for iterating over HealthMap data stored
in a girder database, scraping and cleaning the content of the linked source articles,
and generating pickles from it.

# Training the classifier

New data may be generated using the `train.py` script:

    $ python train.py

This script relies on having the [corpora](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/corpora) data available.
